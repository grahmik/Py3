# THE WEIGH IN

 This was my first bit of code written by myself in Python 3. 
 It started as a prompt on Codecademy.com, but quickly evolved
 into something that Codecademy couldn't run. On Codecademy you
 are sort of limited in what you can do depending on where you
 are in the course. Since this was so early on in the course, I 
 wasn't able to do certain things, like imports.

 I spent entirely too long on this, as it took me most of a day, 
 but I learned a ton: module imports, time, int, float, booleans
 etc...

 I wasn't a fan of the way the print command just spits things out 
 to the screen, so I used the time function to make it feel more
 interactive.

 Give it a whirl, and see what you would weigh on the planets in our
 solar system!
