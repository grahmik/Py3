# ORDER HELPER

 A small project, left unfinished. This was to help me get to know tkinter a bit,
 and my first dive into a GUI. I wasn't really a fan of the way tkinter works, or
 looks, so I moved on. However, the basic function of adding the number of pizzas
 together and printing the results works.
