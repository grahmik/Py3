# PAPER ROCK SCISSORS 

 I made this on 4/26/2023 as a way to continue learning python 3. This silly little program
 helped me with lists, imports, methods and formatting. It does have a problem when the game
 asks you to play again. I will leave it as is and learn from that issue and apply my knowledge
 moving forward. Try it out and see if you can beat the computer or figure out where I went wrong
 when looping back to play again.

 Thanks for playing!
